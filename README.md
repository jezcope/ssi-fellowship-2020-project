In January 2020
[I was awarded a Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship][fellowship],
to kickstart a cultural heritage data science network at the British Library.
I plan to work as openly as possible on this project,
and this repository is home to plans, reports and other documents
related to the work.

Take a look at my application video
for more info about my plans:
