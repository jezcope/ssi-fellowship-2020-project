# WIP Cultural Heritage Data Science Network project brief

## Introduction

### Motivation: why are we doing this?

Cultural heritage work, like all knowledge work, is increasingly data-based. The proper skills to use this data enable more effective working. Knowledge and experience thus gained improves understanding of and empathy with users also using such skills.

### Goals

This project is intended to change the working practices of people in Cultural Heritage (CH) organisations in two ways:

1. Make more and better use of data in their own operational work

2. Have a better understanding of the ways our users make use of CH data, to better plan and deliver services

### Success/impact measures

- Survey participants on measures of both goals at start and end of project
- Conduct pulse surveys throughout to check for needed course corrections
- Collect 3-4 case studies of specific impacts

### Assumptions

We assume that:

- Data skills are accessible to all given time and the right support
- Time, motivation and confidence are the key barriers to adoption
- Peer support is more sustainable for intermediate learners than central training (which is still ideal for novices)

### Risks

| **Risk** | **Impact** | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Mitigation** |
|----------|------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
|          |            |                |              |                |
|          |            |                |              |                |

### Budget

Up to £3,000 is available to support this work through the [SSI Fellowship](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme). It is anticipated that this will cover:

# Strategy

We will work towards the two goals stated above by:

- Show (don't tell!) people what is possible and relevant to their work
- Develop transferrable skills of question-asking and computational problem-solving
- Situate those skills in context(s) relevant to the learner
- Break down language barriers between data scientists and others
- Create online and offline safe spaces to admit knowledge gaps, ask questions and learn from peers
