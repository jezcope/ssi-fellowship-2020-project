** Introduction

*** Motivation: why are we doing this?

Cultural heritage work, like all knowledge work, is increasingly data-based. The proper skills to use this data enable more effective working. Knowledge and experience thus gained improves understanding of and empathy with users also using such skills.

*** Goals

This project is intended to change the working practices of people in Cultural Heritage (CH) organisations in two ways:

1. Make more and better use of data in their own operational work

2. Have a better understanding of the ways our users make use of CH data, to better plan and deliver services

*** Success/impact measures

- Survey participants on measures of both goals at start and end of project
- Conduct pulse surveys throughout to check for needed course corrections
- Collect 3-4 case studies of specific impacts

*** Assumptions

We assume that:

- Data skills are accessible to all given time and the right support
- Time, motivation and confidence are the key barriers to adoption
- Peer support is more sustainable for intermediate learners than central training (which is still ideal for novices)

*** Risks

*** Budget

Up to £3,000 is available to support this work through the [[https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme][SSI Fellowship]]. As well as funding development opportunities for the Fellow, it is anticipated that this will cover:

- Costs of fellowship-related inter-site travel for the Fellow and other members of the network
- Catering and venue hire for network events
- Travel costs for external speakers
- (Possibly) CPD costs for network members

*** Stakeholders

- British Library staff as potential network members
-

* Strategy

We will work towards the two goals stated above by:

- Show (don't tell!) people what is possible and relevant to their work
- Develop transferrable skills of question-asking and computational problem-solving
- Situate those skills in context(s) relevant to the learner
- Break down language barriers between data scientists and others
- Create online and offline safe spaces to admit knowledge gaps, ask questions and learn from peers

** Activities
